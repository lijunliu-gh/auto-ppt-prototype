# Project Status

Current version: **v0.7.8**

Product positioning: **to-B PPT generation engine** — embeddable into enterprise AI workflows with private deployment, API-driven generation (MCP / CLI / HTTP), and multi-language support (CJK + English). Core differentiators are data security (no data leaves the enterprise), content intelligence (AI-driven layout and visualization selection), and cross-platform output (PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides).

Current release posture: **published in its current scope**. This is an open-source embeddable engine designed for integration into enterprise, team, or individual AI workflows. Future updates focus on bug fixes and community contributions.

| **Theming** | 6 built-in themes + custom theme JSON; `--theme` CLI flag; LLM-suggested theme selection |
| **Brand Templates** | Upload `.pptx` → auto-parse → themed output via python-pptx |
| **Image Pipeline** | Local images, URL images, placeholder protocol for multi-agent collaboration |
| **Chart Handling** | Auto-repair, type correction, string-to-number coercion, graceful fallback to bullet layout |
| **Quality** | Visual QA heuristics, quality scorer, 408 tests (84% coverage) |
| **Security** | Path traversal protection, SSRF blocking, file size limits, subprocess timeout, image extension whitelist |
| **LLM Providers** | OpenAI, OpenRouter, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, DeepSeek, GLM, MiniMax, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

## Maintenance Status

This repository is published as a stable, self-hostable engine.

- Current scope is feature-complete
- Future updates focus on bug fixes, documentation improvements, and community contributions
- The recommended way to evaluate the project is to use the current CLI, MCP, HTTP, and JSON skill entrypoints as documented
