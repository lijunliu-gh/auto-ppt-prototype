# Examples

This file is for people who want to run the project quickly without reading the full documentation first.

## Fastest Successful Run

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Generate a deck from the built-in source brief:

```bash
python py-generate-from-prompt.py --mock --prompt "Create an 8-slide AI workspace strategy deck for executives" --source sample-source-brief.md
```

Expected outputs:

- `output/py-generated-deck.json`
- `output/py-generated-deck.pptx`

## Use A Deck Brief File

Natural-language brief example:

- `sample-deck-brief.md`

Structured brief example:

- `sample-deck-brief.json`

Example prompt using the deck brief as source material:

```bash
python py-generate-from-prompt.py --mock --prompt "Turn this brief into an 8-slide product deck" --source sample-deck-brief.md
```

## Revise The Generated Deck

After the first deck is created:

```bash
python py-revise-deck.py --mock --deck output/py-generated-deck.json --prompt "Compress this deck to 6 slides and make it more conclusion-driven"
```

Expected outputs:

- `output/py-revised-deck.json`
- `output/py-revised-deck.pptx`

## JSON Skill Example

Use the JSON skill request contract when another agent or script wants file-based integration:

```bash
python py-agent-skill.py --request sample-agent-request.json --response output/py-agent-response.json
```

Files to inspect:

- `sample-agent-request.json`
- `output/py-agent-response.json`

## HTTP Example

Start the local service:

```bash
python py-skill-server.py
```

Call the skill:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3010/skill -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @sample-http-request.json
```

## Which Example To Start With

- Start with `sample-source-brief.md` if you want the shortest successful demo.
- Start with `sample-deck-brief.md` if you want to understand what a deck brief looks like.
- Start with `sample-agent-request.json` if you are integrating this project into another workflow.
- Start with `sample-http-request.json` if your system prefers local service calls.
